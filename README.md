# NeOS Raspberry Pi 3 OS
An operating system for Raspberry Pi 3, built from scratch.


A very "low level" project, which includes comminucations with the hardware itself of the Raspberry Pi.
The project is written in C and AArch64 Assembly and includes a lot of parts essential for the operating system to work, including processor initialization, kernel initialization, memory initialization, a filesystem, a frame buffer, etc.

The project is not finished yet and some parts like a keyboard driver are missing, but they will be added soon.
In addition, a bash and an interpreter for this operating system is in the works and will be added too, allowing the user
to control the operating system with commands for creating/deleting files, for example, and even program a bit, creating files that can control the operating system using the interpreter.



I hope you will like this project and find it interesting...
